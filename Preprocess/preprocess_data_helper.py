    Imports the result of a custom SQL query for Castaway features from the PostgreSQL database into a pandas DataFrame,
    with optional filtering by version_season and episode number.

    Parameters:
    version_season (str, optional): The version_season to filter the query by. Default is None (no filtering).
    episode_filter (tuple, optional): A tuple containing a comparison operator ('=', '<', '>') and an episode number.
                                       Example: ('>', 5). Default is None (no filtering).
